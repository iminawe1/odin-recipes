                    <p> Thai Green Curry in 30 minutes made by freshening up store bought curry paste OR with a homemade green curry paste! 
                        <br>
                        Whichever way you go, the one essential step to make a really great green curry is to fry off the curry paste. 

                        Make this with chicken or even entirely meat free. With a sauce this good, you can put anything in it – and it will taste amazing!
                        <br>
                        Along with Pad Thai, Chicken Satay and Thai Red Curry, green curry is the gold standard by which we rate Thai restaurants.

                        It’s the curry we sweat and swear our way through, guzzling down water and wiping our brows when we confidently tell the waiter “give it to us the way it should be – extra spicy!!”

                            Instructions
                        </h2>
                        <h> Green Curry Paste </h>
                    <ol>    
                        <li>Pre-heat oven at 350F. Place coriander seeds, cumin seeds, and white peppercorn on a small baking dish; then put into the oven for 5 minutes or lightly toasted. Let them cool down completely.</li>

                        <li>In a large mortar and pestle, add spices, grind those until you get a powder, followed by your Thai chilies, and grind those into a paste. Next, add your serrano peppers, grind them down; then add your galangal and keep grinding. (Note.- use your grinder to press it along the wall as you gently twist your pestle.)</li>
                        <li>Add lemongrass and grind until pestified, about 3 minutes. Next, grind in your kefir lime till smooth, followed by coriander stem until soft, grind shallots until smooth, next grind garlic until smooth, the zest of one lime, and finally shrimp paste, blending all that.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h> Curry </h>
                        <ol> 
                            <li>In a medium-size pot, add oil, heat that over medium heat until hot, then add all of your curry paste. Cook it down, often stirring until it is relatively dried out, about 3 to 4 minutes; then add garlic, let it cook for 25 seconds or until fragrant, add your chicken stock, and stir that to dissolve the curry paste. </li>
                            <li>Add palm sugar, fish sauce, stir until dissolved; then add coconut milk, kaffir lime leaves, bring it to a light simmer, and reduce the heat to low. Blend with a hand blender until as smooth as you like. </li>
                            <li>Add in your chicken thigh, stir that, and simmer for 7 to 8 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.</li>
                            <li>Add eggplant and simmer for four minutes or until soft, then follow that with snow peas, simmer them until softened to your liking; one or two minutes is usually enough. </li>
                            <li>Season it to taste with lime juice, additional fish sauce, and palm sugar if you feel like it needs it—steep two springs of Thai Basil in the hot curry to release some of that flavor.</li>
                            <li>Serve with white rice, garnish with fried shallots, freshly serrano chili, and fresh Thai basil leaves. </li>
